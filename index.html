    <h1>🚀 Welcome to My Site - OBD IMAGE MODEL VERSION 007 ~ Last updated on June 1st 2025🚀</h1>
    <p>Hey there! This is a minimal placeholder page for my <strong>Open Box Delivery (OBD)</strong> image analysis model. 😎</p>

    <p>
      The model currently achieves around <strong>98% accuracy</strong>—which is pretty awesome,
      but it might still mark <em>~2% of images</em> incorrectly. 
      <br>Every bit of improvement helps reduce manual checks and <strong>save time</strong> in e-commerce operations! 
      🤖💻
    </p>

    <p>
      In the future, I might come up with a better model (or might not—who knows!). 
      <br>But for now, if you want to know more about my work and background, feel free to visit my LinkedIn:
